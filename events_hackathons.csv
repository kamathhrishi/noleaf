The available information only mentions the submission period ending on November 3, 2024, and indicates that the event is ongoing or upcoming without specific dates.

Additionally, a search for the event in 2025 yielded no definitive date information.

Therefore, based on the current data, it is unclear when the hackathon will take place in 2025, and it does not explicitly fall within the specified range of May 1, 2025, to August 31, 2025.","The Privacy4Web3 Hackathon is hosted by DoraHacks, which is headquartered in San Mateo, California, USA.

Although the event is described as virtual, the primary organization behind it is based in the USA, suggesting that the event is effectively located in the USA.

There are no indications that the event is held outside the USA or that it operates in multiple locations globally.","The event titled 'Privacy4Web3 Hackathon' clearly satisfies the criterion of being a hackathon.

The event description emphasizes collaboration among developers to build projects using specific technologies (Sapphire and ROFL), which is characteristic of hackathons.

Additionally, the event features a substantial prize pool of $130,000, offers live workshops, and provides networking opportunities, all of which are common elements of hackathons.

The event format encourages coding, problem-solving, and project development within a competitive framework."
"Blade Hack","","https://bladehack.tech","","",Yes,Unclear,Yes,-,-,"The Blade Hack event includes specific dates: May 11, 2025 (first challenges released), May 15, 2025 (submission for challenges and release of Grand Challenge), and May 17, 2025 (submission for Grand Challenge).

All these dates fall within the range of May 1, 2025, to August 31, 2025, thus satisfying the criterion.","The Blade Hack event does not explicitly mention its location on the website or in the gathered search results.

The content retrieved from the official page (https://bladehack.tech) discusses the nature of the event and its challenges but lacks any specific details regarding the venue or geographic location.

Additionally, the search results did not provide relevant information indicating that the event is taking place in the USA.

Given the lack of explicit or indirect evidence confirming the location, it is concluded that the event's location remains ambiguous.

Therefore, based on the available information, I cannot definitively state that the event is located in the USA.","The 'Blade Hack' event is described as a hacking competition focused on prompt engineering and manipulating AI models.

It allows participants to form teams and involves multiple rounds of challenges, culminating in a Grand Challenge, which is typical of hackathons.

Additionally, there are competitive elements such as a cash prize and incentives for creativity, further confirming its classification as a hackathon."
